# Putting It All Into Practice {.tabset}

Once you have filled out the [Research Design Form](research-design.html) and received funding, or perhaps even completed your project, you will confront a series of other challenges. 

This module currently lists a few of those challenges with associated links and references that might prove useful, including: workflow, Pre-Analysis Plans, 

## Contenu

### Workflow

How will you remember what you did a year, or two, or ten, after you did it? How will you ensure that the tables and graphs and results that you use to guide policy decisions are not the result of copy and paste errors? Or that your code did not involve an inadvertantly reverse-coded variable, yielding the opposite conclusion than you have just told the Minister of Health? Although no approach can prevent all errors, some basic approaches to organizing work can help you. These involve, at their root, a move from someone doing quick essays to turn in at the end of a term (essays never to be subsequently serious revisited) to someone participating in a decades-(or centuries-)long collaboration with other scholars and policy makers across time and space.

  - The [pre-mortem approach to project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) approach to project management in which the team imagines that a project has failed before launching the project.

### Faire face aux contraintes du monde réel

 - Working with partners: humility and respect and listening
 - Budgets and physical limits on the size of the experimental pool (limits on control of the randomization)
    - Example: Cluster-randomized designs with small number of clusters

### TODO Pre-analysis plans

### Comment présenter un tableau ou un graphique des résultats

 - Tufte on Ink to Information Ratio.
 - @gerber_field_2012, Chapter 13

### Validité externe, généralisation, mise à l'échelle
